# USYD COMP5048 Covid Hygenric Analysis
### From 31/08/2021 To 30/10/2021
The most efficient individual strategy so far is encouraging vaccination strategy. From the analysis and observation in this report, enforcing good hygienic processes was feeble since it did not stop the first covid outbreak in early 2020. Encouraging testing did decrease the first covid outbreak in 2020 but fail to control the second major delta covid outbreak in 2021. The performance of travel restriction did not meet the expectation to stop the spread in outbreak in 2021. Vaccination policy was applied in later 2021 and controlled the more threatening delta coronavirus from further spreading. However, when vaccination policy was activated, good hygiene and testing policy are still valid. Hence, the combination of enforcing good hygiene, encouraging testing, and encouraging vaccination strategy provided the best performance to control the Covid-19 pandemic in NSW.
